<!-- Flickr instructions
Your goal in this assignment is to create a web app that lets you search Flickr and that displays thumbnails from the results. The minimum requirements, if using the Flickr API, are that:

Your app have a webpage that takes a user's input for one or more things for which to search (this could be text, it could be a tag, it could be a location, etc.).

Your app search Flickr based in this user input and display at least five thumbnails.

Note: Pages on App Engine have a maximum execution time. As you experienced in HW6, conducting a search for 500 images, or even calling flickr.photos.getinfo on several photos, can take a long time. We recommend keeping your per_page count low, and, at least at first, using just flickr.photos.search to generate your results.-->

    <form action="flickersearchresponse" method="post">
       <!-- Here is only a basic form. Please add more HTML codes based on your design. !-->
       <input type="text" id="search_input" name="search_input"/>
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" name="gobtn"/> 
    </form>
